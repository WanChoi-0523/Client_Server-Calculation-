# Client_Server-Calculation-
1. Unzip the file.
2. First, compile the server and the client separately with a terminal or compiler (enter javac GachonClient.java if terminal)
3. Run the server first. Recommended as a terminal (ex: java GachonServer)
4. Then run the client (ex: java GachonClient)
5. If connected, four-basic operations can be performed. First, write down which operation you want to perform (ADD, DEL, MUL, DIV), and write down two operands to perform the operation (ex: ADD 1 2)
6. If you want to disconnect, type "bye" in the client
